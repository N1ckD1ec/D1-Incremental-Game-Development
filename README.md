# CMPM 121 D1 Project

This is the starting point for your CMPM 121 D1 project. The goal of this project is to create a simple web application using TypeScript, Vite, and modern web development practices. Students should make sure to remove _this_ content from their README.md file and replace it with their own project documentation.

Inspiration 1: Took isschrack idea of adding sound to the clicker. isschrack added a loud explosion type sound to the clicker everytime you would click. I was inspired by this idea and creted something similar to it. In my clicker every time the clicker is pressed it plays a different note/sound, so if you keep spamming the button it plays like a tune(sort of).


Inspiration 2: Took kaitlyn-png strucutre or how symmetrically it looked and try to apply it. I made the buttons bigger and alligned everything to the center.
